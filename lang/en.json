            "paragraph1": "Non-profit association, legally constituted and registered in the Autonomous Registry of Associations of Valencia. All board positions are unpaid. The work carried out by all its members is altruistic and voluntary.<br/><br/>Most of its activity is developed in the Shelter for abandoned dogs located in the municipality of Xàtiva. It holds all the necessary licenses and administrative authorizations, both municipal and regional. It has been recognized as a Zoological Center number V-207 since May 7, 2002, and is a Collaborating Entity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fishing, and Food of the Generalitat Valenciana by resolution dated October 14, 1997.<br/><br/>This Shelter is located on its own land thanks to the first donation from Mr. Roberto Cortes, and later from Mr. Francisco Aguado, who financially facilitated the acquisition of an adjoining plot, allowing the installation and permanent establishment of the shelter.<br/><br/>Many personal and financial efforts have gone into conditioning it with new constructions, electrical installations, automatic drinkers, open areas for recreation, a veterinary clinic for the animals' care, tree planting for shade, construction of septic tanks, drainage, storage for food and feed, and many necessary projects still to be carried out.<br/><br/>Situated in a highly flood-prone area, part of the premises has been flooded on several occasions; however, thanks to the invaluable help of timely and extraordinary donations, new works have gradually been carried out to reduce the damage caused by rains and floods as much as possible.<br/><br/>Its ONLY COMMITMENT is the protection and defense of animals in general and dogs in particular. IT ONLY TAKES IN DOGS. It does not house cats due to a lack of economic and human resources necessary to provide them with a dignified life in captivity, as the few foster homes available are already full and do not address the severe problem these animals face.<br/><br/>IT OPPOSES AND CONDEMNS any mistreatment, aggression, or injustice towards animals, no matter where or from whom it comes. From those who applaud it to those who promote it. From those who justify it to those who tolerate and spread it. A soft, insensitive, and permissive legislation on this issue is, continues to be, and will be the greatest ally to the brutality in this country, sadly making it our distinguishing mark.<br/><br/>We only wish for RESPONSIBLE ADOPTIONS. We are against giving animals as gifts for Christmas, birthdays, and other special dates, and we are very tired of the public authorities' indifference to the injustices committed against animals. Also, of irresponsible, whimsical owners who abandon their animals without caring about their fate, and of those who, irresponsibly, throw animals over the refuge’s fences or leave them tied up to their fate. Or elderly house pets who will die from sorrow, and sometimes we cannot do anything to prevent it.<br/><br/>Any animal, regardless of age or physical or functional limitations, is always welcome in our shelter, with special attention given to abandoned elderly animals, unadapted ones, and puppies.<br/><br/>We consider STERILIZATION as the only means to eradicate unwanted litters, which fill municipal shelters and roads with death and blood, and we believe in education and awareness about this silent, bloody tragedy happening every day in this country.<br/><br/>We rely on VOLUNTEERS as the key to this Society’s operations and base the Association's economic survival on members, sponsors, individual donations, public subsidies, companies, and APU.<br/><br/>To those who help us — members, sponsors, individuals, and companies — we are grateful for continuing to support our work as they have until now and trusting all the work we have done over the years. To those who are here for the first time, if you cannot give an opportunity to those who so desire and deserve it, at least, with your help, they can live a little better, thank you.",

            "paragraph2": "The idea of creating an animal welfare association in Xàtiva came up after a meeting of a group of people sensitized to the issue of animal welfare, eager and excited to take action in this field, as the municipal alternative to abandoned animals was that after a few days in the municipal pound, if no one claimed them (as was often the case), the animal would be euthanized.<br/><br/>The aforementioned meeting took place on the fourth floor of the former Casa de la Cultura around February 1985. Later, on March 5 of the same year, the Society for the Protection of Animals and Plants of Xàtiva was established, and it was legalized on April 10 of the same year.<br/><br/>Since there was no infrastructure, a member named \"Rosarín\" donated her land, which was part of her home, to begin sheltering abandoned dogs from the very first moment this society was founded.<br/><br/>Later, member Antonio Romero temporarily offered his chalet in Rotglà, which suffered from damages due to the large number of dogs housed there.<br/><br/>Finally, thanks to Mr. Roberto Cortés, the association secured a permanent location. In 1987, he donated the <b>current land</b> and a donation (which was not his last) to begin construction of the current facilities.",

Currently, the President is Jordi Ruiz.<br/><br/>All the actions and improvements of this association would not have been possible without the help of all the volunteers, our two employees (Salva and Eric), and the members of the Board of Directors who have been part of this association, and with their constant work and dedication, they have contributed to our cause.",
